# Honk-more-wait-more

# Introduction

In India ,people often honk without a cause distrubing other people and creating noise pollution .
this project forces them to honk less as the more they honk ,while waiting at the red light ,the more will they have to wait at the red light  

this project based on system which is  installed by Mumbai police  to tackle the problem of “reckless honkers”, which resets the red traffic signal every time the sound of car horns goes above a certain  decibels
It is also known as the  “the punishing signal”

# Core idea behind this

The sound sensor takes the input as the sum of the amplitude of the honking by the vehicels and if the value crosses a certain limit i.e in our case 286 result of this timer reset the waiting time to 30 seconds
